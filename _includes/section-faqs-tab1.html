        <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-line"></i>
    </h3>
    <div class="faq__description">
        <p>NDC(New Distribution Capability) is an XML-based data transmission standard developed by IATA
            to modernize airline distribution. It enables richer, more personalized offers from airlines
            and allows travel agencies to access content directly, rather than relying solely on
            traditional GDS systems.</p>

    <h3 class="faq__title">What is an aggregator?
        <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-line"></i>
    </h3>
    <div class="faq__description">
        <p>An aggregator connects multiple airline NDC APIs into a single platform, allowing travel
            sellers to access, book, and manage offers from various airlines through one integration.
            This simplifies development and improves efficiency by avoiding separate connections with
            each airline.</p>
